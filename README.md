# SnowflakeOdbcAdapter

Based on the [odbc_adpter](https://github.com/localytics/odbc_adapter) that seems to not been maintain since rails 5.1. And despite the [fork](https://github.com/singlespot/odbc_adapter) we made to follow the rails evolution.
We decide to create a new gem, dedicated to connect with the Snowflake odbc driver.

## Installation

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
